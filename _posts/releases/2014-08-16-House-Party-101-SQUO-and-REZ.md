Established local producers SQUO and REZ have come together for their first major worldwide release! With a meticulously developed synth line, driving beats, and vocals reminiscent of a phone call from your friend about that house party you were at the other night, SQUO and REZ have delivered with an absolutely banging track! This track is the first of many upcoming releases from label-owners REZ and SQUO and is the kind of track you want to party to all night long.
