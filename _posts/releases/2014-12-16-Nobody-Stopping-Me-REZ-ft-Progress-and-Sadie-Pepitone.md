REZ teams up once again with Progress & Sadie Pepitone for a follow up single to conclude their fall tour! Nobody Stopping Me combines a catchy piano riff with powerful poetry from Progress as Sadie floats over this smooth tune. This release marks Progress's first release on Wild Kings, and the future of Progress & REZ will show them as a continuing force in both Hip Hop & Dance Music through Wild Kings & Wild Jokers.
