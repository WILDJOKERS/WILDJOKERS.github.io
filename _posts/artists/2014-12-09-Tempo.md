Currently Tempo works with REZ at Rez studios in Randolph NJ, and is in search of a strong team. as he sets off to create this next chapter in his life that could be the one to open all the doors he's dreamed of since a little boy.. And once given that chance, Tempo said he wants to give back to the community. And start an agency that helps adopted children and orphans, to help them recieve the opportunity to become something as he has been given.
